# covid19-weather
Project aiming to find correlation between outbreaks of COVID-19 across the United States and daily local weather patterns

While my initial analysis and report found little predictive ability of weather (not normalized against multitudes of other correlated socioeconomic variables) using decision tree regression, I plan on continuing to expand this project to encompass a greater range of variables and algorithm designs.
